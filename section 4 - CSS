    <h1>Introduction to CSS</h1>
    <p>CSS is for Cascading Style Sheets, the cascade means the styling goes from general to more specific. SS means the Style Sheet language.</p>
    <p>There are three types of CSS, inline, internal and external. The first is written as an attribute in the tag that is gonna be stylized, being useful for changing
    a specific part of the website. The internal is written inside the content of the head element and styles all the tags inside the html, which is good to change a website.
    The external CSS is used calling a css file, usually named styles.css, which applies all the styles in the html file, being useful for multi-page websites.</p>
    <p>Inline example: <h2 style:"color: blue">Style me blue</h2></p>
    <p>Internal example:
    <head>
      <style>
        html{
          background-color: red;
        }
      </style>
    </head></p>
    <p>External example: 
      <head>
        <link rel:"stylesheets" href"./styles.css" />
      </head>
      styles.css:
      h1{
        color: green
      }
    </p>
