<h1>Advanced CSS</h1> 
<h2>Display</h2>
<p>A paragraph element, by default, has it's display property set to block, which means a block of the widht of the whole page is created where the text is written. The span element has a inline display as default, which makes the 
element occupy only the lenght of the content, but unable to change it's width and height. The inline-block is a middle-term property, which allows to have multiple blocks in the same line, with changeable width and height.</p>
<h2>Float</h2>
<p>The float property allows to make text wrap around the element. For example an image with the property float:left followed by a paragraph, has the text wrapped on its right side, until the image is over and the text goes back
to the full line. The clear property allows to remove any float property an element has e.g. footer{clear:left}</p>
