<h1>CSS properties</h1>
<h2>CSS colours</h2>
<p>There are two ways of writing the values of colours in CSS, the name of the color or it's hexcode. The hexcode represents the rgb numbers of a specific color. The site <a href="https://colorhunt.co/">colorhunt</a> is 
useful to find many color palletes and their hexcodes. The mdn color page can also be used to find the desired colours.</p>
<h2>CSS font size</h2>
<p>There are four types of font sizes values. Pixels (px) and points (pt) are absolute values, the latter being bigger than the first. In microsoft word, the size of the font is in points. em and rem are relative font-sizes,
the number that precedes then are how many times the font will be bigger than the relative. em is relative to the parent, while rem is relative to the root, the html element. Usually, it's better to use the rem to avoid 
confusion.</p>
<h2>CSS font family</h2>
<p>The font families can be found at <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">google fonts</a>. This website provides links to install the fonts in the user computer and the property:value syntax. The links are paste in the head
element of the html. When writint the font-family, it's used the main font followed by a backup font, in case the user doesn't have the first installed.</p>
<h2>font align</h2>
<p>The font can be aligned by left, center, right, justify, start and end.</p>
<h2>CSS weight</h2>
<p>The weight of the font determines if the content is bold or light. The value bold makes the text bold. A numerical value between 100-900 can also be used, the higher the number the bolder the text becomes.
Lighter and bolder are values that make the content -100 or +100 bolder relative to the parent.</p>
<h2>CSS inspection</h2>
<p>In Google Chrome, use the F12 or inspect option to open the Chrome Developer Tools. In there, it's possible to visualize the code behind the html and CSS of the website. The styles tab is useful to know which properties
are applied to a specific element of the website. The CSS overview tab is very useful to find the website's colours and font families used.</p>
<h2>CSS box model</h2>
<p>width and height: the values used can be a number of pixels or a percentage of the screen. If we use 100%, the whole width or height of screen is used to display the element that is being stylized.</p>
<p>border: The border propertie has three values, thickness, style and color. The thickness controls how thick the border is. The style defines if the line is solid, dashed, dotted, etc. And the color defines the border color
. Example: border: 10px solid black. There are properties that can be added to the border. If border-top is set to 0px, the top part of the border won't exist. The border-width property can have 2 or 4 values. If 4 values are
used, it follows the sequence 1:top, 2:right, 3:bottom and 4:left. If 2 values are used, the first changes the 1/3 borders, while the second changes the 2/4.</p>
<p>The padding adds a space between the element and the border. The margin is also used to add spacing, but in the part outside of the border. The padding and margin can also accept 2 or 4 values like the border-width</p>
