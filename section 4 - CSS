    <h1>Introduction to CSS</h1>
    <p>CSS is for Cascading Style Sheets, the cascade means the styling goes from general to more specific. SS means the Style Sheet language.</p>
    <h2>CSS styles</h2>
    <p>There are three types of CSS, inline, internal and external. The first is written as an attribute in the tag that is gonna be stylized, being useful for changing
    a specific part of the website. The internal is written inside the content of the head element and styles all the tags inside the html, which is good to change a website.
    The external CSS is used calling a css file, usually named styles.css, which applies all the styles in the html file, being useful for multi-page websites.</p>
    <p>Inline example: <h2 style:"color: blue">Style me blue</h2></p>
    <p>Internal example:
    <head>
      <style>
        html{
          background-color: red;
        }
      </style>
    </head></p>
    <p>External example: 
      <head>
        <link rel:"stylesheets" href"./styles.css" />
      </head>
      styles.css:
      h1{
        color: green
      }
    </p>
    <p>
    <style>
      inside the style there is a property:value e.g. color: blue
    </style>
    </p>
    <h2>CSS selectors</h2>
    <p>A CSS selector is the part that selects the html to apply whichever rules goes in the curly braces {}. Element selector selects a tag to style all of it's elements e.g. h1{properties:values}. </p>
    <p>Classes are attributes that can be added to any html element. Classes group html files, so that they can be all stylized by using class selectors. </p>
    <p>class example:
        <h2 class="red-font"> red color</h2>
        <p class="red-font"> also red. </p>
        in styles.css
        .red-font{
          color: red;
        }
    </p>
 <p>ID's can also be added to any html element. ID selector is written by #ID. The id are unique, only one per element, that is the difference between this selector and class selector </p>
    <p>id example:
        <h2 id="green-font" class="red-font"> now green color</h2>
        <p class="red-font"> this is red. </p>
        in styles.css
        .red-font{
          color: red;
        }
        #green-font{
          color: green
        }
    </p>
 <p>Attribute elements can be used to style the elements with a specified attribute by using element[attribute] e.g p[draggable]. </p>
    <p>id example:
        <h2 id="green-font" class="red-font"> now green color</h2>
        <p class="red-font"> this is red. </p>
        in styles.css
        .red-font{
          color: red;
        }
        #green-font{
          color: green
        }
    </p>

 <p>ID's can also be added to any html element. ID selector is written by #ID. The id are unique, only one per element, that is the difference between this selector and class selector </p>
    <p>id example:
        <h2 id="green-font" class="red-font"> now green color</h2>
        <p class="red-font"> this is red. </p>
        in styles.css
        .red-font{
          color: red;
        }
        #green-font{
          color: green
        }
    </p>
